# Vue 3 + Vite + PokeVue

This template is a starting point for developing a Vue 3 application using Vite. The template leverages Vue 3's `<script setup>` Single-File Components (SFCs), allowing you to create more concise and organized components. For more information on the `<script setup>` feature, please refer to the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using the package manager of your choice:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For an optimal development experience, we recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the following extensions:

- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) - Provides advanced Vue 3 support for VS Code.
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) - Offers enhanced TypeScript support for Vue 3 projects.

To set up your VS Code environment for this project, make sure to disable the Vetur extension as Volar already provides complete Vue 3 support.

## Purpose

PokeVue is a project aimed at providing a didactic environment to explore Vue.js 3 with Vite. The goal is to showcase advanced Vue.js 3 features, such as the Composition API and the `<script setup>` block. Additionally, it demonstrates how to make asynchronous API requests using the Fetch API to fetch and display real-time data about PokÃ©mon.

Feel free to use this template as a foundation for your Vue 3 projects and experiment with the latest Vue.js features.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
