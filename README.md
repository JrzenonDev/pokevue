# Vue3 + Vite + PokeVue

This template is a starting point for developing a Vue 3 application using Vite. The template utilizes Vue 3's Single-File Components (SFCs) `<script setup>`, allowing you to create more concise and organized components. For more information about the `<script setup>` feature, see the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup ).

## Starting

1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using your package manager of choice:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     wire installation
     ```
4. Run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     yarn developer
     ```
5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173) to view the application.

## Recommended IDE configuration

For an optimal development experience, we recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the following extensions:

To set up your VS Code environment for this project, be sure to disable the Vetur extension as Volar already fully supports Vue 3.

## Purpose

PokeVue is a project that aims to provide a didactic environment for exploring Vue.js 3 with Vite. The goal is to showcase advanced features of Vue.js 3, such as the compositing API and the `<script setup>` block. Additionally, it demonstrates how to make asynchronous API requests using the Fetch API to fetch and display real-time data about PokÃ©mon.
